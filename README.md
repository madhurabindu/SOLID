# Design Principles

## Overview
SOLID design principles help us create code that is easy to maintain, easy to extend, easy to read / understand as the software evolves and grown in size.

## S O L I D Principles
1. **S**ingle Responsibility
2. **O**pen/Closed
3. **L**iskov Substitution
4. **I**nterface Segregation
5. **D**ependency Inversion

### Single Responsiblity Principle
<p align="center">
  <i>A class should have one, and only one, reason to change..</i>
</p>


## Open Closed Principle
<p align="center">
  <i>A module should be open for extension but closed for modification.</i>
</p>

## LISKOV Principle
<p align="center">
  <i>Subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.</i>
</p>

## Interface Segregation Principle
<p align="center">
  <i>Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface</i>
</p>

## Dependecy Inversion Principle
<p align="center">
  <i>Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.</i>
</p>

## Component Principles
